## Welcome to the Intelligent Systems Laboratory!

We welcome you to the Intelligent Systems Laboratory (INTELLIGENTiSTs) at the Department of Electrical and Information Technology (EIT) of Lund University, Sweden.
We conduct research on intelligent systems and machine learning with systems perspective in several domains, including autonomous systems, Internet of Things (IoT),
medical informatics, mobile health and wearable technologies. We work with intelligent systems and study (artificial) intelligence,
hence we refer to our members and laboratory as INTELLIGENTiSTsâ„¢ (just like "scientists").
Below is a snippet of our recent research activities in the TinyML community for mobile medical systems in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain.
Right now, open communities are building amazing software together, and there are excellent "good first issue" opportunities, if you're looking to get involved.
